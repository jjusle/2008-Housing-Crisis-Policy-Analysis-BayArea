# 2008-Housing-Crisis-Policy-Analysis-BayArea
This is my UCSC ECON 114 Final Project on the 2008 Housing Crisis Poilicy Analysis Report that is focused on two counties in the Bay Area: San Francisco and Santa Clara. 

# Abstract
This paper discusses the effects of policies that were introduced, passed, and became law as a result of the 2008 Housing and Financial Crisis on overcrowded houses in the state of California. This study focuses on counties in the Bay Area such as San Francisco and Santa Clara from the years 2006-2015. The measures of administrative data and surveys are provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy, and U.S. Census Data. This study utilizes the Differences-in-Differences regression analysis method to determine the effects of policies using Santa Clara during 2009-2013 as a control. These results reveal that the policies implemented after the 2008 Housing and Financial Crisis had decreased the local estimate of overcrowded houses by 1.8 percent.
